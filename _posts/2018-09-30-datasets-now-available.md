Both datasets are now available for downloading. Please select one of the two competition tracks below.

* **Molecular Dynamics Dataset** (scientific track) can be downloaded as a
  [312MB ZIP file](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/MEowmO1Jqm83Chx/download). Alternatively, you
  can download this dataset in the PDB file format which can be loaded easily into VMD and (unlike the
  XTC files) is human-readable. Download
  [the first 5 microseconds](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/sjHKvEYfDWlOIeQ/download) (181MB
  compressed) and
  [the last 15 microseconds](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/n8Esr7ETUNCjQaW/download) (614MB
  compressed) of the simulation. Please note that neither Paraview nor VisIt work nicely with PDB files:
  they can see the variable names but cannot load them properly.
* **Orlando British Women's Writing Dataset** (humanities track) is available in two formats:
  [zipped RDF-XML files](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/0NOio2vRbgjUjwo/download) (19.2MB) and
  [zipped RDF-TTL files](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/4B4ATo4NMWwkUW3/download)
  (16.8MB). Alternatively, you can retrieve RDF triples from a <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL" target="_blank">SPARQL</a> end point at <a
  href="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/sparql" target="_blank">http://sparql.cwrc.ca/sparql</a> as detailed <a
  href="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/vizchallenge" target="_blank">here</a> -- look for a sample query at the
  end.
