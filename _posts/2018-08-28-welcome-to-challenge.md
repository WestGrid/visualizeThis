## What is the Visualize This! Challenge?

Now in its third year, Visualize This! is a Canada-wide competition that aims to celebrate the innovative
ways visualization can help researchers explore datasets and answer important scientific
questions. Visualize This! is your chance to challenge your creativity, experiment with new visualization
tools, and contribute to the growth of data visualization in Canada!

This year’s Visualize This! Challenge is hosted by WestGrid, a regional partner of Compute
Canada. Together with the Compute Canada Visualization Team, we want to bring your creative visualization
ideas and workflows to life and make them accessible to all Canadian researchers!

To participate in the Challenge, please register your interest here.

This year’s contributed dataset is a multi-scale aerodynamical model of several counter-rotating
vertical-axis wind turbines. It will be available for download from October 1 to November
30, 2018. Submissions are due no later than November 30 at midnight (PST).

## Prizes

To be eligible for a prize, you must be registered as a participant. Register here!

These are just a few of the prizes we have up for grabs:

- 43 Ultra HD 4K Multi Client Monitor (Generously donated by Dell EMC)
- High-capacity SSD drives
- Free registration and subsidized travel to a WestGrid 2018 Research Computing Summer School
- Your visualization showcased on the websites of Compute Canada, WestGrid, Compute Ontario, Calcul
  Québec, and ACENET.
- Opportunity to present to the research community at an upcoming Compute Canada/WestGrid event

## How to Participate

- Register your interest here.
- Download the dataset.
- Final solutions must be submitted via email to viz-challenge@westgrid.ca no later than November 30,
  2018 (11:59 pm PST)
- When you submit, please include both your visualization and the workflow, be it a script, a state file,
  etc. so that we can reproduce your solution.
- Please do not attach large files (over 1 MB) to the email, but instead share them with us using any of
  the popular sharing tools such as Dropbox, Google Drive, ownCloud, or a shared cluster
  filesystem. Alternatively, you can upload your solution via anonymous ftp (write-only, no read access)
  “ftp blowfish.westgrid.ca (log in as anonymous, empty password); cd incoming; put yourLocalFile” or
  with a single command “curl -T yourLocalFile ftp://blowfish.westgrid.ca/incoming/ –user
  anonymous:”. With multiple files please pack and compress them into an archive before uploading.
- Late submissions will not be considered.

## Want tips for how to make your Visualize This entry stand out?

WestGrid is hosting a special online tutorial that will demonstrate how to create animations on static
objects (zooming in, fly-troughs, spinning around, turning layers on/off) in both ParaView and VisIt.

If you have questions about the challenge or your entry, bring them to this session and we'll answer them
for you!

## Why is Visualization Important?

Science is producing an unprecedented amount of data on everything from predicting weather and ocean
changes to searching for distant galaxies. Visualization tools allow researchers to explore these large
datasets interactively without being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data. Ultimately, visualization
enables researchers to answer the important scientific questions facing us today.
