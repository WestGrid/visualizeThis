you have any questions, please contact viz-challenge@westgrid.ca.

> Can we work in a team?

Yes, participants can form teams, but a team will be considered as a single entrant and will be eligible
to win only one prize.

> Is there a limit to how many people can be on a team?

No. There is no limit to the number of people who can be part of your team. It can be as large or as
small as you like.

> Do all team members need to register their interest?

No. Only one member of the team needs to register your interest in the challenge. Click
[here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/3rd-annual-visualize-this-challenge-registration-48899166724) to
register your interest.

> What are the deadlines?

Both datasets will be available for downloading from October 1 to November 30, with submissions due by
midnight Pacific Time on November 30, 2018. Winners in both tracks will be announced in December.

> How will my application be judged?

Submissions will be reviewed by members of the Compute Canada Visualization Team. Points will be given
for:
- interactive visualizations,
- visualizing the 3D multi-scale nature of the data,
- online presentation in a browser, and
- clear innovative display of multiple variables.

> Who is eligible to participate?

The competition is open to anyone affiliated with a Canadian post-secondary institution (college or
university) or research organization. Participants from all research fields are encouraged to enter. The
competition datasets provide a valuable learning opportunity to enhance your visualization skills, no
matter what your research area may be.

> I have never used WestGrid or Compute Canada resources before. Can I still participate in the
> Challenge?

Yes. Your visualization does not need to be developed or implemented on WestGrid or Compute Canada's
platforms. However, if you would like to use WestGrid or Compute Canada computational resources for your
visualization, you can register for an account
[here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account). If you have
any questions about getting an account, please email accounts@computecanada.ca.

> I am not affiliated with a Canadian university, post-secondary institution, or research
> organization. Can I participate in the Challenge?

Yes. If you partner with or join a team of someone who is affiliated with a Canadian university,
post-secondary institution or research organization, you can participate in the Visualize This!
Challenge.

> I donâ€™t live in Canada, but I have a WestGrid or Compute Canada account. Can I participate in the
> challenge?

Yes. If you have a WestGrid or Compute Canada account and are registered in the Compute Canada DataBase
(CCDB), you are eligible to participate in the Visualize This! Challenge, even if you are not living in
Canada.

> What visualization tools can be used in the competition?

Participants can use any open-source visualization tool, including ParaView, VisIt, domain-specific
packages, online Javascript/WebGL tools, Python visualization libraries, or any other open-source
software you feel comfortable using.

<!-- visualization tools that can be used. Click here to view the archive recording (to get right to the -->
<!-- dataset tour, skip ahead to 4:04 in the video). -->

> Will any technical support be provided to participants?

If you have a specific technical question, please email viz-challenge@westgrid.ca or bring it to our
Visualize This! Tips & Tricks kickoff workshop on September 27. In general, we expect participants to
create their own visualization(s), so technical help will be limited to answering very specific
questions.

<!-- Our kickoff workshop will share more details on the dataset, supply sample routines to read the data, and -->
<!-- demonstrate a few basic visualization examples. Click here to register for the workshop. -->

> Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP) rights?

Both datasets for this year's competition were kindly provided by Canadian researchers and are their
property or the property of their university. Participants own the rights to their visualization, but not
to the original dataset(s). By submitting an application to the Visualize This! Challenge, the
participant is providing consent for the use, reproduction, publication, transmission and/or broadcasting
of his/her name, likeness, and/or prize information, and the solution, without compensation, in any
publication or promotion by WestGrid or Compute Canada for the purposes of promoting the competition, the
winners, and/or the benefits of visualization to research.

> Can I use my own dataset?

No. In both the scientific and humanities tracks, all participants will work with the same dataset, which
has been provided to the Challenge by a researcher. Both datasets will be made available on the
competition webpage, and participants can download it anytime after October 1, 2018.

> How do I submit my solution?

Solutions must be submitted via email to viz-challenge@westgrid.ca.

Please follow these instructions when submitting:
- Submit both your visualization and the workflow, be it a script, a state file, etc. so that we can
  reproduce your solution.
- If you have any large files (over 1 MB), do not attach them to the email. Instead, share them with us
  using any of the popular sharing tools such as Dropbox, Google Drive, <a
  href="https://www.westgrid.ca/resources_services/data_storage/cloud_storage" target="_blank">WestGrid's
  ownCloud</a>, <a href="https://transfer.sh" target="_blank">transfer.sh</a>, <a
  href="https://wetransfer.com" target="_blank">WeTransfer</a>, or a shared cluster filesystem. With
  multiple files please pack and compress them into an archive before uploading.

> When do I submit my solution?

Participants can submit their solutions at any time during the competition between October 1, 2018 (12:01
am PST) and November 30, 2018 (11:59 pm PST). Late submissions will not be considered.

> Can I submit more than once?

Yes. Each submission will be time-stamped and the last submission received before the deadline date/time
from each participant will be what is considered the final for submission.
